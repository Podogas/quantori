    I have failed to find solution to play audio with only using html and CSS, unless it is
    autoplay synced to  animation.
    I have tried to play around with embed element and display property. <embed> only played audio once, it is not re-rendering inner document.
        "Although, switching the being rendered state of an <object> or <embed> element is supposed to reload entirely its inner Document,
        which means also its DOM tree. Now, only Safari behaves like that, Firefox never implemented that behavior,
        and Chrome did recently change their to match FF's one, against the specs."
    
    Also, I have tried to add audio inside <slot> and <template> tags. This didn't work out.
    Just trying to make some magic with shadow DOM, but I can't find anything in CSS that can somehow change DOM.  -->

    const horAnimationCycleLengthInMs = (horComputedStyle.animationDuration.match(regexp)[0]*1000);
    // It's a Bad decision. Index is related to all CSS animations and if someone changes animations order, this all be messed up.
    const horAnimation = document.getAnimations()[0];
